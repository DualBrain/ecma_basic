A .Net implementation of the ECMA-55 and ECMA-116 BASIC standards.

![Screenshot for v0.1](images/v0.1.PNG)

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple 80's style BASIC environment for learning how to program.

Fire up ecmabasic55.exe to get a standard-looking BASIC prompt, then start firing off those line numbers!  You can also provide a .BAS file as a parameter to ecmabasic55.exe to run it in batch mode.  Type in a program, then use the SAVE command to save it to a file.  LOAD will bring a program back into memory.  RUN will... run the program...
